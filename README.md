## Installation

In order to use this application, you will need to have a coding application and run an npm i for inquirer, and mysql2. 

## Usage/Tests

Once you're set up in the coding application of your choice, run node index.js in the terminal to start the Employee Tracker!  I've added some seeds to give you a template for you to fill in with your own employees, roles, departments, etc. Simply choose which menu item you'd like to see or change, then answer the prompted questions. Once finished, Employee tracker will display your new tables.
